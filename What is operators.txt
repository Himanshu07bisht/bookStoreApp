What is operators?
Operators are those which perform some specific task.

What is operand?
Operand are those in which operators are used.

How many types of Operators?
There are 7 types of operators in python:-
*Arithmetic Operator:-
=> There are Seven types of Arithmetic Operator 
.Modulus(%):- It gives remainder after dividing the two number.
.Exponent(**):- It produce the power of a number.
.Floor Division(//):- It remove the decimal place after dividing the two no.

*Relational/Comparison Operator:-
=> Relational operator is used to compare between two number. It gives true or false.
  There are six types of operator
*Greater than (>)
*Greater than equal to (>=)
*Less than (<)
*Less than equal to (<=)
*equal to (==)
*Not equal to (<>)

*Assignment Operator:-
=> Assignment Operator is used to Assign the value of a variable.The value always assign from right to left.
  There are six types of assignment operator
* = :- c=a+b;
*c+=b :- c=c+b;
*c-=a :- c=c-a;
*c*=a :- c=c*a;
*c/=a :- c=c/a;
* c%=a :- c=c%a;

*Identity Operator:-
 Identity Operator are used in Python to determine the class or type of a value. 
type() function is used to in indentification.

There are two types of indentity operator 
.is:- It return true if both are in same object
.is not :- if it not belong to the same object so it print true.

*Membership Operator:-
 There are two types of Membership Operator:
.in :-If element is found then it return true.
.not in :- if element is not found than it return true.

*Bitwise Operator:-
 Bitwise Operator are used to compare the binary number.
 There are six types of Bitwese operator,
Let x=0000 0110
    y=0000 1000

.&(AND)= x&y = 0000 0000
.|(OR)= x|y  = 0000 1110
.^(XOR)= x^y = 0000 1110 (XOR means to have only single "1" is present)
.~(NOT)= x~y = 1111 1001 (it is also known as x complement)
.<<(Zero fill left shift)= x<<1 = 0000 1100
.>>(Signed right shift)= x>>1 = 0000 0011
